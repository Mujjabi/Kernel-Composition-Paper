R Code for the Phenotypic Analysis in the Kernel Chemical Composition Paper

File "GrainQualityData_AmesPanel.csv" contains the raw data obtained from the NIR analysis of the inbred lines in the Ames diversity panel 

File "Wis-Rawdata.csv" contains part of the raw data from Renk 2021 supplimental tables, for a set of 275 common genotypes between Renk 2021 study and our study. This dataset contains the 275 genotypes tested in 5 environments with 2 replicatons per environment.

File "Final Analysis_AmesPaper.R" contains the R Code used to conduct the phenotypic analysis and comparison of data between replicared (Renk 2021) and our unreplicated experiment. 

File "TableValue.csv" Contains the compositional trait means and estimated Blups for each heterotic maize group obtained in our study (Ames_means & Ames_Blups) and the trait Blups of the similar heterotic groups reported in the Renk 2021 paper (Wisc_Blups). The values in the Wisc_Blups were obtained from Table 2 (Summary of best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP)-adjusted mean differences for each compositional trait compared among maize types) in the Renk 2021 paper. TableValue file was used to conduct the correlations between the obtained Blups in the 2 studies.
