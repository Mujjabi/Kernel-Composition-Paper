R Code for the Phenotypic Analysis in the Kernel Chemical Composition Paper
File "GrainQualityData_AmesPanel.csv" contains the raw data obtained from the NIR analysis of the inbred lines in the Ames diversity panel 
File "Wis-Rawdata.csv" contains part of the raw data from Renk 2021 supplimental tables, for a set of 275 common genotypes between Renk 2021 study and our study. This dataset contains the 275 genotypes tested in 5 environments with 2 replicatons per environment.
File "Final Analysis_AmesPaper.R" contains the R Code used to conduct the phenotypic analysis and comparison of data between replicared (Renk 2021) and our unreplicated experiment. 
File "TableValue.csv" Contains the compositional trait Blups for each heterotic maize group reported in the Renk 2021 paper. This is Table 2 "Summary of Blup-adjusted mean differences..." in the Renk 2021 paper
